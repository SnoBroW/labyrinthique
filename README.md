Python random maze generator/solver

This is a highschool project I did about 3 years ago.
It consists of a random maze generator and a solving "AI".

Controls:

Use arrow keys to move;
Press P to solve automatically (if you moved before pressing P the program will go back at the start of the maze).


Unfortunately, the program doesn't find the quickest route to the exit yet, that is still an improvement to come.
Also, for sizes above 100 it is rather slow to generate.

And before you ask, yes, we were too lazy to rotate the player icon, so we just made 4 different images alternate depending on the direction you're going.


Have fun,
